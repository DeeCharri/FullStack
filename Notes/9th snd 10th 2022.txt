What is frontend
The part that users actullly see and interacts with
or
whatever we can see it on browrser

What is BackEnd
The part that allows to operate the code and user can't see it.
or
This part accepts the requests from front end and do some operations on that

What is DB
This is collection of tables that contains list of information

What is FullSTack 
Fullstack is a combination of frontend,backend and database

FrontEnd <--> BackEnd <--> Database
User sends the request to backend through front end ,then backend [this is one server ]will perform some operations , backend server interacts with DB server 
and fetch the related info , then send it to front end ,den user can see that result.

Clients are nothing but we only /users.

Once we developed the website we host it into public server . so that all users/people can use that application.
each website has it's own domain name. 
for ex: google.com is domain main
domain name : The name given to each website
domain has it's own ip address. for ex google.com ip address 258.0.124.8[just for ex]
once we enter the domain name (google.com)--> it will check the related ip address --> start doing the operation -> den we can see the home page of google.com
