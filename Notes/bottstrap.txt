Bootstrap : This is free front-end framework  for easier  and faster development.
It has all html and css based design templates for button,forms,models,columns,tables etc..
It is used for to make the page more responsive.

===================================================================================================
what is optimize : To keep our project lean, responsive and maintainable.

here we just need to add the classed to our tags which we have mentioned in our page.
we can add more than one class

<div class="container container-sm">

classes:
default container
1.container:This is fixed width container

responsive container - this is allow to speficy 100% wide until the spcified breakopint is reached
1.container-sm -> 100% wide until it reached small breakpoint
2.container-md -> 100% wide until it reached medium breakpoint
3.container-lg -> 100% wide until it reached large breakpoint
4.container-xl -> 100% wide until it reached extra large breakpoint
5.container-xxl --> extra extra large

class fluid:this is used for full widht, it cover the width of entire screen
1.container-fluid:

Grid:
=========================================================================================================================
Boot strap grip contains list of rows and columns to layout and align the content.
grid has 12 columns , each column width is 100%/12 =8.333
we should have to add columns from 1 to 12. if we add the columns the columns count will be 12 or less than 12.

if we want to mneiton the columns thr parent sohuld be row class.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-1"></div>
<div class="col-3"></div>
<div class="col-2"></div>
</div>

Grid Options: we have 6 default breakpoints
1.xs- extra small
2.sm - small
3.md -medium
4.lg -large
5.xl-extra large
6. xxl - extra extra large

classes:
1.if we want to make the equal width of col , we use "col" class.

2.variable width content:
we use col-{breakpoint}-auto classes used to make the column size based on the natural width of their content.

3.Responsive classess : Bootstrap grid has 6 tiers of pre-defined classes for building responsive layouts.

4.stacked to horizontal : this is used to set the grids/divs/columns in horizontal line once it reached breakpoints.
we have 6 breakpoints. if we mnetion breakpoint as small , it will be breaked once it reached small break point
ex:
we have 3 classes , they placed in stack manner , minize screen until it reached small/medium/any break point ,
then 3 columns will be arranged one by one horizontally like rows
for that we have to "col-sm"

5.Mix and match : here we can use any columns like 1 to 12

6.Rows columns : we use rows-cols-* to giive the tyle to both rows and columns

7.Nesting: to add a style to our tags within tags / To nest your content with the default grid
===========================================================================================================================================================

COlumns: Boot strap will help us to modify the columns using allignments,orderring and offsetting

Allignments: to allign the element vertically/horizontally
1)vertical : we have 3 columns ,we want to make them more interactuve/more colorfull/ we use align-items-center/left/right/top/bottom/* and we use align-self-*

2)horizontal: here we use justify-content-center

3)column wrapping : we have placed 12 columns in a single row ,rows willl be set until it reaches the 100% width after  they will wrap on to new line.

4) column breaks : if we want to breaking columns and set them into new line , a simple hack is set the one column element as 100% width

5,Reordering - 
   a.order classes - we useed for controling the visual order of content. we use order-breakpoint we have 1 to 5 break points.we have spevifed them in col class
in the below ex:
<div id="div1" class="col order-5" style="border:1px solid green;">
					     First in DOM, no order applied
					 </div>
					 <div id="div2" class="col order-1" style="border:1px solid green;">
					     First  First in DOM, no order applied First in DOM, no order applied First in DOM, no order applied
					 </div>
					 <div id="div3" class="col order-3" style="border:1px solid green;">
					     First in DOM, no order applied First
					 </div>

before adding the order , we display the div tags like this, div1,div2,div3
after adding the order, div will be displayed based on order numner[1-5] .in above ex div 2 is in 1st place, div3 is in 2nd place and div 1 is in 3rd place

6)offset columns : we can make offset column by using offset class and margin utilities
a.offset class: used to move the columns to right side using offset-md-1/23/4//*
if we mention 3 it moves over 3 classes

b.in margin utilies we use me-auto and ms-auto/ms-breakpoint[sm/md/etc]-auto to move the columns
if we are using class me-auto the other class should be col-auto
if we are using class ms-auto/ms-break-point we should use col-breakpoint-[1 to 12] class

=========================================================================================================================================================

background colors
we use 
bg-primary
bg-secondary
bg-light,
bg-danger,
bg-dark,
bg-success,
bg-info
bg-warning
bg-body
bg-white
bg-transprant

===========================================================================================================================================================

gutters are used to give the padding between 2 columns. we use gx-*[any numbers] in parent class and 
we use p-[the number should be eq/less than which we have mentoined in gx-] in child class for padding. 
ex: if we mention gx-5 ,the p-[it should be equals to 5 less than 5]
